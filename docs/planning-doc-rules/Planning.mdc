Use these rules mdc file when I mention "Plan a"

Create an md doc file

Include Checklists and steps

Create the file under docs/plans and auto increment it starting with 0

Add in the file name prefix if BE or FE scope

Always make sure that when planning the concept should include if it's "react-rules" or "nest-js-rules"
